# nanofq

A simple Rust program designed for processing nanopore long reads, providing functionalities such as statistics generation, filtering, and adapter trimming.

## Installation

To get started with `nanofq`, follow the steps below. Ensure you have Cargo version 1.85.0 or higher installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aadali/nanofq
cd nanofq
cargo build --release 
```
> Note: For generating statistical plots, `python3` along with the `matplotlib` library is required.

## usage

```
$ ./nanofq --help
A simple program for nanopore fastq file to stats, filter, trim...

Usage: nanofq [COMMAND]

Commands:
  stats   stats nanopore fastq, output the stats result, summary and figures
  filter  filter nanopore fastq by length, quality or gc content
  trim    trim adapter, barcode, primer that artificial sequence in nanopore fastq
  help    Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help     Print help
  -V, --version  Print version
```
### Input Parameters
For all subcommand, there are three possible input scenarios:

1) **Standard Input(stdin)**
2) **Single Fastq File** - A text-based fastq or gzipped fastq ending with `.fq`, `.fastq`, `.fastq.gz` or `.fq.gz`
3) **Directory of Fastq Files** - A folder containing one or more fastq files (text-based or gzipped). The program will only process files matching the specified extensions

### Output
The output can be directed to either standard output (stdout) or a specific file path. Gzipped output is not supported.

```
The program processes all input fastqs and outputs the statistical results to the specified `--output` file and a summary to the `--summary` file. If the `--plot` option is enabled, it also generates visualizations similar to the following:

<img alt="length_and_quality_distribution" height="240" src="./doc/distribution.png" width="400"/>

This figure was generated from an uncompressed fastq file containing 16.8G bases, 1460671 reads, with an N50 of 21849 and a mean length of 11523. The command took 12.5 seconds to execute on a MacBook Pro with an M4 CPU and 16GB of RAM.

```bash
nanofq stats -i test.fastq -o test001.stats.tsv -s test001.summary.txt -t 4 --plot ./test001 -f pdf -f png -f svg
# with 4 threads,
# stats test.fastq in current dir, 
# output stats result: test001.stats.tsv and summary file: test001.summary.txt

The `trim` subcommand uses local alignment to identify and remove adapter, barcode, and primer sequences from the ends of long reads. Currently, it supports some commonly used kits from ONT. You can also specify your own primers using the `--primers` option, and degenerate bases are supported.
1) For some kits, such as NBD and LSK, the adapter or barcode sequences at both ends of each read are fixed. Trimming these reads is straightforward, and no other scenarios are considered.
   ```bash
   # SQK-LSK114
   LSK114 library reads structure
             |--->  LA_ADAPTER_5   <----|   insert Seq   |--->   LA_ADAPTER_3   <---|
   5-TTTTTTTTCCTGTACTTCGTTCAGTTACGTATTGCT-..............-AGCAATACGTAACTGAACGAAGTACAGG-3
   3 end always is truncated
   
   
   # SQK-NBD114-24; SQK-NBD114-96
   NBD114-24/96 library reads structure
   Example for Native Barcode01
             |NA_ADAPTER_5                |L_F_5   |Barcode01 rev com       |R_F_5   |insert Seq         |L_F_3   |Barcode01               |R_F_3         |NA_ADAPTER_3
   5-TTTTTTTTCCTGTACTTCGTTCAGTTACGTATTGCT AAGGTTAA CACAAAGACACCGACAACTTTCTT CAGCACCT ................... AGGTGCTG AAGAAAGTTGTCGGTGTCTTTGTG TTAACCTTAGCAAT ACGTAACTGAACGAAGTACAGG-3
   we use barcode_left_flanking + barcode + barcode_right_flanking as query to trim nbd reads
    ```
2) However, for kits like PCS and PBC, or custom primers, the adapter sequences at both ends of each read may vary. The structure of the reads is as follows:
   ```bash
   # SQK-PCB114.24 structure
        | BP01                   | SSPII                                               | insert Seq with polyA | CRTA                                             | BP01 reverse com
   5-...AAGAAAGTTGTCGGTGTCTTTGTG TTTCTGTTGGTGCTGATATTGCTTTVVVVTTVVVVTTVVVVTTVVVVTTTGGG .........AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA CTTGCGGGCGGCGGACTCTCCTCTGAAGATAGAGCGACAGGCAAGT     CACAAAGACACCGACAACTTTCTT...-3
   3-...TTCTTTCAACAGCCACAGAAACAC AAAGACAACCACGACTATAACGAAABBBBAABBBBAABBBBAABBBBAAACCC .........TTTTTTTTTTTTTTT GAACGCCCGCCGCCTGAGAGGAGACTTCTATCTCGCTGTCCGTTCA     GTGTTTCTGTGGCTGTTGAAAGAA...-5
   
   # CRTA structure
   The full structure of CRTA is:
   CRTA:                      5'-CTTGCGGGCGGCGGACTCTCCTCTGAAGATAGAGCGACAGGCAAGT-3'
   CRTA_REV_COM:   3'-TTTTTTTTTTTGAACGCCCGCCGCCTGAGAGGAGACTTCTATCTCGCTGTCCGTTCA-5'
   ```
   The read from sequencer may be the fwd strand with BP01 + SSPII at 5'end, CRTA + BP01_rev_com at 5'end or 
the rev strand with BP01 + CRTA_rev_com at 5'end, SSPII_rev_com + BP01_rev_com at 3'end. So each read may be aligned twice. For primers, the same applies.
3) For Rapid kit, only the 5'end will be trimmed
   ```bash
   SQK-RAD114; SQK-ULK114
   the rapid adapter(RA) from ont document is 5'-TTTTTTTTCCTGTACTTCGTTCAGTTACGTATTGCT-3', but RA_ADAPTER will be used when trimming reads with Rapid Adapter(R    A)
   Always consider only the adapter at 5 end for Rapid library

    structure of reads with RA, but no barcode
      |RA_ADAPTER we want to trim from reads                             | insert Seq
    5-GCTTGGGTGTTTAACCGTTTTCGCATTTATCGTGAAACGCTTTCGCGTTTTTCGTGCGCCGCTTCA-...................-3
   ```
